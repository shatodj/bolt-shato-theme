Running PHPStan and Easy Codings Standard
=========================================

If you're working on improving this extension (as opposed to working _with_ 
this extension), you might want to run the built-in configurations for ECS and 
PHPStan.

First, make sure dependencies are installed:

```bash
composer install
```

And then run ECS to find potential issues:

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check src
```

Or to fix them automatically:

```bash
vendor/bin/ecs check src --fix
```

Run PHPStan:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpstan
```
